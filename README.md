### Description
Write your thoughts down and schedule them to come to you later! The app builds over the concept of [spaced reptiiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition). It reminds you to revisit your learnings and thoughts in a spaced interval of time so that you can **retain and recall** things efficiently.
